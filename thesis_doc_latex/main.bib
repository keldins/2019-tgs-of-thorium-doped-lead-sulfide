abstract = {We consider in depth the applicability of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law, namely that the electronic thermal conductivity ({\$}\backslashkappa{\$}) is proportional to the product of the absolute temperature ({\$}T{\$}) and the electrical conductivity ({\$}\backslashsigma{\$}) in a metal with the constant of proportionality, the so-called Lorenz number {\$}L{\_}0{\$}, being a materials-independent universal constant in all systems obeying the Fermi liquid (FL) paradigm. It has been often stated that the validity (invalidity) of the WF law is the hallmark of an FL (non-Fermi-liquid (NFL)). We consider, both in two (2D) and three (3D) dimensions, a system of conduction electrons at a finite temperature {\$}T{\$} coupled to a bath of acoustic phonons and quenched impurities, ignoring effects of electron-electron interactions. We find that the WF law is violated arbitrarily strongly with the effective Lorenz number vanishing at low temperatures as long as phonon scattering is stronger than impurity scattering. This happens both in 2D and in 3D for {\$}T{\textless}T{\_}{\{}BG{\}}{\$}, where {\$}T{\_}{\{}BG{\}}{\$} is the Bloch-Gr$\backslash$"uneisen temperature of the system. In the absence of phonon scattering (or equivalently, when impurity scattering is much stronger than the phonon scattering), however, the WF law is restored at low temperatures even if the impurity scattering is mostly small angle forward scattering. Thus, strictly at {\$}T=0{\$} the WF law is always valid in a FL in the presence of infinitesimal impurity scattering. For strong phonon scattering, the WF law is restored for {\$}T{\textgreater} T{\_}{\{}BG{\}}{\$} (or the Debye temperature {\$}T{\_}D{\$}, whichever is lower) as in usual metals. At very high temperatures, thermal smearing of the Fermi surface causes the effective Lorenz number to go below {\$}L{\_}0{\$} manifesting a quantitative deviation from the WF law. Our work establishes definitively that the uncritical association of an NFL behavior with the failure of the WF law is incorrect.},

One of the expected nuclear reactions caused by thermal neutrons was verified experimentally by performing gamma-ray spectroscopy on each irradiated sample. Increases in the electrical resistivity for irradiated n-type PbTe and Bi2Te3 were found to meal at temperatures below 200OC. For irradiated n-type PbTe most of the increase in the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient can be explained by the decrease in carrier concentration, which was determined by Hall coefficient measurements. Measurements of the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient as a function of temperature for irradiated and unirradiated samples cut from the same ingot are given for all materials except p-type PbTe. For the latter sample only the measurements of the Seebeck coefficient are given.},

The deposition was found to depend strongly on substrate pre-treatment with sodium selenosulphate in an aqueous KOH solution. In cases where this stage of the process was neglected, film growth did not occur. The sequence of precursor addition and the pH of the solution were also found to be dominant factors affecting film growth. The film growth rate, grain size and the resulting roughness were all shown to increase with pH. Study of film growth kinetics revealed the selenide limited nature of the system. These factors were shown to be critical for reproducible deposition of high quality PbSe thin films.},

The method is based on homogenously dissolving minute amounts of 228Th ions in thin films in a controllable manner using a small volume chemical bath deposition technique. This approach is demonstrated for PbS films. The properties of the PbS (228Th) solid solution film activity were investigated by monitoring the accompanying radioactive processes. Electrical resistivity studies were performed and decay-event damage accumulation was measured, followed by isochronal annealing which presented two annealing stages and another two sub-stages. This is the first report on self-irradiating damage studies in IV-VI semiconductors and the resulting films present a novel method for the analysis of dilute defect systems in semiconductor thin films.},

The present work aims at optimizing the conditions for growing PbS thin films on ZnTe in light of the solubility of ZnTe in the alkaline environment required for chemical bath deposition of PbS. The morphology and properties of these films are strongly affected by altering the solution pH, temperature and the reagent concentrations. A detailed structural and chemical analysis reveals the different orientation relationships present between the constituent layers and highlights the spontaneous formation of new, distinct intermediate layers in the unique local environment formed due to the simultaneous dissolution of the ZnTe layers in the presence of precursors for PbS thin film deposition.},

abstract = {Irradiation-induced void swelling remains a major challenge to nuclear reactor operation. Swelling may take years to initiate and often results in rapid material property degradation once started. Alloy development for advanced nuclear systems will require rapid characterization of the swelling breakaway dose in new alloys, yet this capability does not yet exist. We demonstrate that transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) can detect void swelling in single crystal copper via changes in surface acoustic wave (SAW) velocity. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) links the TGS-observed changes with void swelling-induced microstructural evolution. These results are considered in the context of previous work to suggest that in situ TGS will be able to rapidly determine when new bulk materials begin void swelling, shortening alloy development and testing times.},

abstract = {This paper overviews the history of infrared detector materials starting with Herschel's experiment with thermometer on February 11th, 1800. Infrared detectors are in general used to detect, image, and measure patterns of the thermal heat radiation which all objects emit. At the beginning, their development was connected with thermal detectors, such as thermocouples and bolometers, which are still used today and which are generally sensitive to all infrared wavelengths and op? erate at room temperature. The second kind ofdetectors, called the photon detectors, was mainly developed during the 20th Century to improve sensitivity and response time. These detectors have been extensively developed since the 1940's. Lead sulphide (PbS) was the first practical IR detector with sensitivity to infrared wavelengths up to {\~{}}3 $\mu$m. After World War II infrared detector technology development was and continues to be primarily driven by military applications. Discovery of variable band gap HgCdTe ternary alloy by Lawson and co?workers in 1959 opened a new area in IR detector technology and has provided an unprecedented degree offreedom in infrared detector design. Many ofthese advances were transferred to IR astronomy from Departments ofDefence research. Later on civilian applications ofinfrared technology are frequently called “dual?use technology applications.” One should point out the growing utilisation ofIR technologies in the civilian sphere based on the use ofnew materials and technologies, as well as the noticeable price decrease in these high cost tech? nologies. In the last four decades different types ofdetectors are combined with electronic readouts to make detector focal plane arrays (FPAs). Development in FPA technology has revolutionized infrared imaging. Progress in integrated circuit design and fabrication techniques has resulted in continued rapid growth in the size and performance ofthese solid state arrays.},

abstract = {Colloidal quantum-confined semiconductor nanostructures are an emerging class of functional material that are being developed for novel solar energy conversion strategies. One of the largest losses in a bulk or thin film solar cell occurs within a few picoseconds after the photon is absorbed, as photons with energy larger than the semiconductor bandgap produce charge-carriers with excess kinetic energy, which is then dissipated via phonon emission. Semiconductor nanostructures, where at least one dimension is small enough to produce quantum confinement effects, provide new pathways for controlling energy flow and therefore have the potential to increase the efficiency of the primary photoconversion step. In this review, we provide the current status of research efforts towards utilizing the unique properties of colloidal quantum dots (nanocrystals confined in three dimensions) in prototype solar cells and demonstrate that these unique systems have the potential to bypass the Shockley-Queisser single-junction limit for solar photon conversion. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Thin films of PbS and CuxS on glass substrates, deposited from chemical baths, are shown to possess excellent solar control characteristics-superior or comparable to the metallic solar control coatings. For example, for an acceptable range of integrated optical transmittance (approximately 10-20{\%}) in the visible region, the integrated infrared reflectance for AM2 solar spectrum for the different glazings are: PbS coated glass, 50{\%}; CuxS coated glass, 14{\%}; stainless steel/Cu coated glass, 25{\%} and tinted glass, 4{\%}. The CuxS and PbS coatings also have the advantage of giving pleasant reflected colours (golden, purple, blue, etc), which improves the cosmetic appearance.

abstract = {Cultured primary adult rodent heart cells are an important model system for cardiovascular research. Nevertheless, establishment of robust, viable cultured adult myocytes can be a technically challenging, rate-limiting step for many researchers. Here we described a protocol to obtain a high yield of adult rat heart myocytes that remain viable in culture for several days. The heart is isolated and perfused with collagenase and protease under low Ca2+ conditions to recover single myocytes. Ca2+-tolerant cells are obtained by stepwise increases in extracellular Ca2+ concentration in three subsequent wash steps. Cells are filtered, resuspended in culture medium, and plated on laminin coated slips. Cultured myocytes obtained using this protocol are viable for up to four days and are suitable for most experiments including electrophysiology, biochemistry, imaging and molecular biology.},

abstract = {Americium oxides samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy, with an emphasis on their structural behavior under oxidation and self-irradiation. Raman spectra of americium dioxide (AmO2) and sesquioxide (Am2O3) were obtained for the first time. With the help of literature data on isostructural oxides, Raman signatures of Ia-3 C-type Am2O3and P-3m1 A-type Am2O3are identified. For AmO2,a clear band is noted at 390 cm-1. Its nature is compared to that of the other actinide dioxides. Am2O3evolution under ambient conditions and against241Am $\alpha$ self-irradiation was monitored by powder XRD. The sample, initially composed of A-type Am2O3as major phase as well as C2/m B-type and C-type structures as minor phases, progressively oxidizes to Fm-3m AmO2-$\delta$over a few months. On the basis of diffractogram refinements, evolutions of unit cell volumes caused by self-irradiation are also determined and discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

It was found that the average value of hole concentration within the sample space area where properties were modified by ion implantation and vacuum annealing was equal to (3.25 ± 0.30) ? 1018 cm–3. The depth of the space in question was estimated and its quantity was shown to make the tenths of micrometers. It was demonstrated that because of annealing process oxygen ions occupied places in the chalcogen sublattice healing anion vacancies. It was also found that vacuum annealing of lead sulfide with implanted oxygen did not cause elimination of all anion vacancies. Moreover, the concentration of sulfur vacancies increased considerably in comparison with its value in the initial samples non-subjected to ion implantation. This fact testifies that oxygen in lead sulfide possesses acceptor action which is compensated by chalcogen vacancies. It was established that in the lead sulfide, the only quasi-local energy level, being located in the valence band at the energy distance of 0.16 eV from its top, was connected with oxygen impurity. No other energy level which one could connect with oxygen or with the complexes containing oxygen in lead sulfide was revealed.

@phdthesis{Bajaj2016,
abstract = {This thesis discusses the application of phase diagrams and the associated thermodynamics to semiconductor materials through theoretical computational calculations. The majority of work is focused on thermoelectric semiconducting materials that enable direct inter-conversion between electrical and thermal energy. First, one of the most efficient thermoelectric material, PbTe, is picked to demonstrate the assessment of unknown phase diagrams by combining two methods - DFT and CALPHAD. Since there had been no previous investigations of defect stability in this material using computations, DFT is used to deduce the stability of various intrinsic point defects, and in turn attribute origins of n- and p-type conductivity to the most stable defects. Then, the calculated defect formation energies are used in the Pb-Te thermodynamic model built using the CALPHAD method to compare the estimated solubility lines and non-stoichiometric range of the PbTe phase with experimental data. Next, another lead chalcogenide, PbSe, is picked to explore the phase stability of the PbSe phase upon the addition of dopants (Br, Cl, I, Na, Sb, Bi, In), which is a common strategy to make thermoelectric materials and devices more efficient. The range of efficiencies and thermoelectric properties as functions of composition and temperature that can be achieved depends on the amount of dopant that can be added without precipitating secondary phases. Also, depending on the system and its phase diagram, there can be more than one way of doping a material. To help detail which method(s) of doping into PbSe will result in maximum dopant solubility, a procedure similar to the above for PbTe is followed by using DFT in combination with Boltzmann statistics to map solvus boundaries of the PbSe phase, but now in the ternary phase space of composition and temperature. This method also helps predict electrical conductivity, n- or p-type, in each region of the phase diagrams that represent different doping methods. Lastly, the role of surface energy contributions in changing phase stability at nano-dimensions is explored. The CALPHAD approach is employed to investigate these changes in three systems by calculating their phase diagrams at nano dimensions and comparing them with their bulk counterparts.},

@phdthesis{Moll1999,
abstract = {In Silicon microstrip and pixel detectors are the key devices for the measurement of particle trajectories in elementary particle collision experiments. In present-day and future high luminosity experiments (e.g.$\backslash$ ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and HERA-B) they have to operate in extremely intense hadronic radiation fields where radiation damage of the detector bulk material leads to severe deterioration of the detector properties. It is even foreseeable that some of the devices produced from standard detector grade silicon and exposed to the highest irradiation levels will not survive the envisaged operational period of the experiments. Hence, the improvement of the radiation tolerance of the detector bulk material is of prime importance and was the main goal of this thesis. The radiation induced changes in the effective doping concentration and the leakage current have been systematically investigated and parameterized as function of particle fluence, annealing temperature and annealing time. Furthermore, as a possibility for defect engineering, the dependence on the oxygen content and the resistivity of the bulk material was studied. The oxygen concentration of the investigated materials reached from below 2x10e14cm-3to 9x10e17cm-3 and the resistivity of the n-type silicon from 110 ohmcm to about 25k ohmcm. It has been found that a high oxygen concentration leads to an improved radiation hardness of the bulk material with respect to the changes in the effective doping concentration for neutron and especially charged hadron irradiation. While for the neutron damage the so-called donor removal is suppressed by the oxygen the main effect after charged hadron irradiation is a reduced introduction of negative space charge (so-called stable damage). The current related damage rate alpha is not influenced by the oxygen concentration or the resistivity of the material. Furthermore, the value of alpha in a well defined annealing state was found to be independent of the fluence in a range from 10e11cm-2 to 10e14cm-2. Based on this result and the NIEL hypothesis an easy to use method has been suggested for the determination of particle fluences, respectively hardness factors. Microscopic defect studies using the Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) and Thermally Stimulated Current (TSC) techniques led to the detection of about 20 radiation induced defect levels. Besides the well known defects VOi, CiOi, CiCs and VV also defects so far not reported in the literature were found and characterized. Furthermore, the material dependence of the defect introduction rates and the defect annealing behavior was investigated in isothermal and isochronal annealing experiments. On the basis of these studies the relations between the microscopic defects and the macroscopic detector properties were discussed in very detail. It was e.g. found that the annealing of an electron trap with a level of E{\_}C - 0.46 eV is most probably responsible for the short term annealing of the leakage current and the effective doping concentration. Furthermore, relations between other defects and the reverse annealing, the stable damage the leakage current and the charge collection efficiency have been investigated. Finally, the present and future possibilities for the production of radiation hard material are discussed and it is argued that for the moment oxygen enriched FZ silicon is the best choice.},

Both macroscopic detector properties (reverse current, depletion voltage and charge collection) as also the underlying microscopic defect generation are covered.

Preliminary studies on the use of dimerized float zone and Czochralski silicon as detector material show possible benefits. An essential progress in the understanding of the radiation-induced detector deterioration had recently been achieved in gamma irradiation, directly correlating defect analysis data with the macroscopic detector performance.},

Within a few minutes, the peaks progressively disappear and a structureless spectrum occurs. A procedure of stabilization of the colloids has been set up in order to allow the study of the structural and optical properties at different stages of their evolution.

abstract = {We discuss how defect production mechanisms in displacement cascades vary according to the nature of the irradiated material. Our discussion is based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation studies and reveal very different mechanisms for metals and covalent semiconductors. For metals we show how melting of the cascade core, in combination with long replacement collision sequences along low index crystallographic directions leads to the production of large number of defects in clusters and a small (≈ 10{\%}) fraction of isolated interstitials well separated from the cascade region. In silicon, we show how the energy deposition process leads to the production of local amorphous regions and very few isolated Frenkel pairs. Because replacement collision sequences are extremely short in the open diamond lattice, very few or no isolated interstitials result. We argue that these observations provide a basis to understand the very large difference in freely migrating defect production efficiency in metals and silicon. The results provide an underlying cause for the extremely high bulk recombination efficiency observed in ion implanted and annealed silicon and provide a physical basis for the "+1" interstitial model in ion implanted silicon.},

@article{Averback1991,
abstract = {Ion beams are being applied for surface modifications of materials in a variety of different ways: ion implantation, ion beam mixing, sputtering, and particle or cluster beam assisted deposition. Fundamental to all of these processes is the deposition of a large amount of energy, generally some keV, in a localized area. This can lead to the production of defects, atomic mixing, disordering and in some cases, amorphization. Recent results of molecular dynamics computer simulations of energetic displacement cascades in Cu and Ni with energies up to 5 keV suggest that thermal spikes play an important role in these processes. Specifically, it will be shown that many aspects of defect production, atomic mixing and cascade collapse can be understood as a consequence of local melting of the cascade core. Included in this discussion will be the possible role of electron-phonon coupling in thermal spike dynamics. The interaction of energetic clusters of atoms with solid surfaces has also been studied by molecular dynamics simulations. This process is of interest because a large amount of energy can be deposited in a small region and possibly without creating point defects in the substrate or implanting cluster atoms. The simulations reveal that the dynamics of the collision process are strongly dependent on cluster size and energy. Different regimes where defect production, local melting and plastic flow dominate will be discussed. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {We use a transient thermal grating technique in reflection geometry to measure the effective thermal diffusivity in GaAs as a function of heat transfer distance at three temperatures. Utilizing heterodyne detection, we isolate the "amplitude" grating contribution of the transient grating signal, which encodes the thermal transport dynamics. As the thermal grating period decreases, and thus the heat-transfer distance, we observe a reduction in the effective thermal diffusivity, indicating a departure from diffusive behavior. Non-diffusive behavior is observed at room temperature, as well as low temperature (180 K) and high temperature (425 K). At the shortest thermal grating period measured corresponding to a heat transfer distance of approximately 1 mu m, the effective diffusivity drops to a value roughly 50{\%} of the bulk thermal diffusivity. These measurements show the utility of the reflection transient thermal grating technique to measure thermal transport properties of opaque materials.},

abstract = {Non-ionising energy loss of radiation produces point defects and defect clusters in silicon, which result in a significant degradation of sensor performance. In this contribution results from TSC (Thermally Stimulated Current) defect spectroscopy for silicon pad diodes irradiated by electrons to fluences of a few 1014cm?2and energies between 3.5 and 27 MeV for isochronal annealing between 80 and 280?C, are presented. A method based on SRH (Shockley–Read–Hall) statistics is introduced, which assumes that the ionisation energy of the defects in a cluster depends on the fraction of occupied traps. The difference of ionisation energy of an isolated point defect and a fully occupied cluster, $\Delta$Ea, is extracted from the TSC data. For the VOi(vacancy-oxygen interstitial) defect $\Delta$Ea=0 is found, which confirms that it is a point defect, and validates the method for point defects. For clusters made of deep acceptors the $\Delta$Eavalues for different defects are determined after annealing at 80?C as a function of electron energy, and for the irradiation with 15 MeV electrons as a function of annealing temperature. For the irradiation with 3.5 MeV electrons the value $\Delta$Ea=0 is found, whereas for the electron energies of 6–27 MeV $\Delta$Ea{\textgreater}0. This agrees with the expected threshold of about 5 MeV for cluster formation by electrons. The $\Delta$Eavalues determined as a function of annealing temperature show that the annealing rate is different for different defects. A naive diffusion model is used to estimate the temperature dependencies of the diffusion of the defects in the clusters.},

The use of SRIM for this purpose has been evaluated and comparisons have been made with an internationally-recognized standard definition of dpa, as well as more detailed atomistic simulations of atomic displacement cascades. Differences between the standard and SRIM-based dpa are discussed and recommendations for future usage of SRIM in radiation damage studies are made.

To date, this has been accomplished by manually controlling the heterodyne phase between measurements with an optical flat. In this letter, an optical configuration is presented which allows for collection of TGS measurements at two heterodyne phases concurrently through the use of two independently phase controlled interrogation paths. This arrangement allows for complete, heterodyne amplified TGS measurements to be made in a manner not constrained by a mechanical actuation time. Measurements are instead constrained only by the desired signal-to-noise ratio. A temporal resolution of between 1 and 10 s, demonstrated here on single crystal metallic samples, will allow TGS experiments to be used as an in-situ, time-resolved monitoring technique for many material processing applications.},

The effects of reagent concentrations at constant deposition time and temperature were studied. The concentrations of NaOH and CS(NH2)2were found to be major factors which affect the film morphology and microstructure. Single-crystal film growth was induced by increasing pH, which, as in the case of increasing temperature, leads to enhanced availability of sulfide anions in solution. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated development of a ?1 1 0? texture with increasing film thickness.

It is established that the PbS films studied have a cubic (space group Fm?m) D03-type crystal structure different from the B1-type structure. Electron microscopic investigation of a film microstructure has shown that about half of all particles have a size of 60 nm and less. In the wavelength range from 300 to 3200 nm the optical transmission of PbS nanostructured cubic films with D03structure and thickness from ?120 to ?400 nm is measured. Decreasing of average size of nanoparticles in PbS films leads to increasing of energy band gap Egfrom 0.85 to 1.5 eV. These values of band gap are larger than that of coarse-grained PbS equal to 0.41 eV.

Carbon and CN thin films were grown on silicon substrate with varying nanocrystalline texturing: some samples were amorphous while others were either nanocrystalline graphite (for the carbon sample) or fullerene-like (for the CN sample), with both samples having a graphitic nanostructure vertically ordered throughout the film. Their thermal diffusivity was computed using transient grating spectroscopy in order to compare the impact of the material's nanostructure on its thermal property as well as benchmarking the performance of CN. It was found that the thermal properties of carbon thin films were decreased when doped with nitrogen, which is attributed to the increased atomic disorder introduced by the nitrogen cross-linking, impacting the phonon propagation. The impact of nitrogen doping on thermal properties opens new avenues in engineering materials with tailored and varying thermal properties at the microscale.},

We review both the production of crystallographic or topological defects in materials as well as radiation mixing, i.e. the process where atoms in perfect crystallographic positions exchange positions with other ones in non-defective positions. All classes of materials except biological materials are considered. We also consider the recent effort to provide alternatives to the current international standard for quantifying this energetic particle damage, the Norgett-Robinson-Torrens displacements per atom (NRT-dpa) model for metals.

A number of recent investigations, experimental and theoretical, have aimed to gather insight into their unique lattice dynamics and electronic structure. However, the majority of first-principles modeling has been performed at fixed temperatures, and there has been no comprehensive and systematic computational study of the effect of temperature on the material properties. We report a comparative lattice-dynamics study of the temperature dependence of the properties of PbS, PbSe, and PbTe, focusing particularly on those relevant to thermoelectric performance, viz. phonon frequencies, lattice thermal conductivity, and electronic band structure. Calculations are performed within the quasiharmonic approximation, with the inclusion of phonon-phonon interactions from many-body perturbation theory, which are used to compute phonon lifetimes and predict the lattice thermal conductivity. The results are critically compared against experimental data and other calculations, and add insight to ongoing research on the PbX compounds in relation to the off-centering of Pb at high temperatures, which is shown to be related to phonon softening. The agreement with experiment suggests that this method could serve as a straightforward, powerful, and generally applicable means of investigating the temperature dependence of material properties from first principles.},

Four of the PbS samples were natural and n type, while the other specimens were synthetic and p type. The synthetic samples contained only a few single crystals but two of the natural specimens were highly polycrystalline. At low temperatures the charge carrier mobilities tend to high constant values similar to those reported elsewhere in single crystals of the same materials. From an estimate of the scattering cross section of the point defects we find evidence for explaining this behavior in terms of metallic rather than semiconducting properties. Maxima attributed to phonon drag have been observed below 20°K in the thermoelectric power of the specimens of highest thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity was similar in all samples at 100°K but varied by as much as two orders of magnitude at 10°K. In order to explain these results it is necessary to consider scattering of phonons by point imperfections, free electrons, and dislocations.},

abstract = {Direct mesoscale measurements of radiation-induced changes in the mechanical properties of bulk materials remain difficult to perform. Most widely used characterization techniques are either macro- or microscale in nature, focusing on overall properties or overly small areas for analysis. Linking the atomic structure of irradiated materials directly with their radiation-affected properties remains one of the largest unmet challenges in radiation materials science. By measuring the change in surface acoustic wave speed as a function of relative orientation on metallic single crystals, we demonstrate that transient grating (TG) spectroscopy experiments have the sensitivity necessary to detect radiation-induced material property changes. We also show that classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used to accurately simulate orientation-based changes in surface acoustic wave speed in TG experiments, by comparing with experimental measurements and theoretical predictions. The agreement between theory, simulation, and experiment gives confidence in classical MD as a predictive tool to simulate defect-based changes in elastic properties, which cannot yet be fully treated by theory. This ability is of critical importance for the informed use of TG spectroscopy to measure material property changes induced by radiation damage, which may vary by amounts formerly too small for reliable in situ detection. Finally, our MD simulation framework is used to study the effect of an imposed vacancy population on the acoustic response of several materials. The results of these studies indicate that TG experiments are well suited to the ex situ and in situ study of radiation-induced material property changes. DOI:},

abstract = {Displacements per atom (dpa), estimated based on the standard Norgett–Robinson–Torrens (NRT) model, is used for assessing radiation damage effects in fast reactor materials. A computer code CRaD has been indigenously developed towards establishing the infrastructure to perform improved radiation damage studies in Indian fast reactors. We propose a method for computing multigroup neutron NRT dpa cross sections based on SRIM-2013 simulations. In this method, for each neutron group, the recoil or primary knock-on atom (PKA) spectrum and its average energy are first estimated with CRaD code from ENDF/B-VII.1. This average PKA energy forms the input for SRIM simulation, wherein the recoil atom is taken as the incoming ion on the target. The NRT-dpa cross section of iron computed with “Quick” Kinchin-Pease (K-P) option of SRIM-2013 is found to agree within 10{\%} with the standard NRT-dpa values, if damage energy from SRIM simulation is used. SRIM-2013 NRT-dpa cross sections applied to estimate the integrated dpa for Fe, Cr and Ni are in good agreement with established computer codes and data. A similar study carried out for polyatomic material, SiC, shows encouraging results. In this case, it is observed that the NRT approach with average lattice displacement energy of 25 eV coupled with the damage energies from the K-P option of SRIM-2013 gives reliable displacement cross sections and integrated dpa for various reactor spectra. The source term of neutron damage can be equivalently determined in the units of dpa by simulating self-ion bombardment. This shows that the information of primary recoils obtained from CRaD can be reliably applied to estimate the integrated dpa and damage assessment studies in accelerator–based self-ion irradiation experiments of structural materials. This study would help to advance the investigation of possible correlations between the damages induced by ions and reactor neutrons.},

While silicon and metals generally do not show mechanical degradation at the radiation levels encountered in most missions, MEMS devices have been reported to fail at doses of as few krad, corresponding to less than one year in most orbits. Radiation sensitivity is linked primarily to the impact on device operation of radiation-induced trapped charge in dielectrics, and thus affects most strongly MEMS devices operating on electrostatic principles. A survey of all published reports of radiation effects on MEMS is presented. The different sensing and actuation physical principles and materials used in MEMS are compared, leading to suggested was to increase radiation tolerance by design, for instance by choice of actuation principle or by electrical shielding of dielectrics. 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

The elastic energy of a surface acoustic wave propagating in a solid medium, is concentrated at the interface between the solid and air (or a sufficiently rarified medium); consequently, high frequency surface acoustic waves with sub-micrometer wavelengths are an extraordinary tool for a qualitative and quantitative elastic characterization of thin films. In this article, a short review is presented to describe the main ultrasound techniques based on surface acoustic waves for thin films characterization and to highlight the probing limits of acoustic nanometrology.},

The structural, optical and photoelectrical properties of these films were studied. The main characteristic of films as thick as 0.12-0.54 $\mu$m is the photosensitivity. This parameter is influenced by many factors such as film thickness, grain and crystallite size, faults probability, number of layers, thermal treatment and the presence of impurities. Optical properties of these films were studied comparatively with those of some Au and Ni layers. The VIS. transmission and NIR reflection are comparable with those of the metallic films.

We have recently reported on chemically deposited, epitaxial single-crystal PbS films on GaAs, and we report here for the first time on single-crystal PbSe films that were directly grown on the same substrates using CD. A gradual transition from weakly oriented domains to ?1 1 1?-oriented growth was obtained on both GaAs(1 1 1) and GaAs(1 0 0) substrates. We demonstrate orientation control in CD PbS (or PbSe) thin films by depositing an intermediate layer of PbSe (or PbS). When deposited on GaAs(1 0 0) substrates, CD PbSe films tend to grow along the ?1 1 1? axis, while CD PbS films grow along the ?1 1 0? axis. Intermediate thin films of ?1 1 0? PbS induced the ?1 1 0? orientation in overgrown PbSe films. Similarly, intermediate films of ?1 1 1? PbSe were used for obtaining ?1 1 1?- oriented PbS films. In both cases, films were grown in orientations that could not be otherwise obtained. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (ED) were used for studying the epitaxial relationship between the film and the underlying intermediate layer. Superimposed atomic position maps were constructed in order to illustrate the orientation relationships obtained.},

abstract = {A refurbished chemical bath deposition technique was developed for growing thin film semiconducting nanocrystalline lead sulphide (PbS) for use in photovoltaics. The goal of this work was to produce good quality crystals, with the high mobility of holes and electrons required for effective carrier separation in photovoltaic applications, and to control other electro-physical properties. Tightly attached, densely compacted, nanocrystalline PbS films with tunable electrical, physical, and optical properties were deposited. Adherence to the substrate was attained by establishing firmly attached kernels on the substrate from which crystallization occurred. Nanocrystalline structures were precipitated unto the substrate by controlling the deposition temperatures, time, concentration of the chemical constituents and ionic products. Using this approach nanocrystalline thin film PbS layers with controllable thicknesses were proliferated. SEM images show rigid crystalline structure, and low impurity concentrations in the film. Hall Effect and spectroscopy measurements illustrate tunable electrical, physical, and optical properties. Carrier concentrations were achieved between 6 ? 1016/cm3-8 ? 1018/cm3and mobility ranged between 3.4 cm2/Vs-33 cm2/Vs. Photoconductivity was measured using 980 nm laser and blackbody at temperature of 450°C and 800°C. Results indicate low recombination rates on the surface. Prolonged exposure to air confirms resistance to oxidation, and stability of the optical and electro-physical parameters.},

abstract = {The design and validation of new alloys for engineering applications is limited by the speed at which materials may be tested. In particular, there exist few methods by which the thermal, mechanical, and structural properties of materials may be monitored in conditions that are dynamically changing their microstructure. These conditions, such as heat treatments, radiation exposure, or corrosive environments, are common when material performance needs to be validated. To offset this lack of capability, new non-destructive experimental tools must be developed to facilitate on-line, real- time testing of materials undergoing some type of evolution. In this thesis, a flexible, all-optical methodology known as dual heterodyne phase collection transient grating spectroscopy is developed for this purpose. This method adapts a traditional spectroscopic technique sensitive to thermal and mechanical properties for real-time use. A formalism is also developed to quantify both elastic and thermal transport properties of materials with second-scale resolution. These new tools are then used to study the short-timescale oxidation kinetics of Fe-12Cr-2Si, a model alloy with oxide layer formation properties similar to large classes of Fr-Cr alloys. By monitoring the effect of thin oxide layers on surface thermal transport, there exists a pathway to continuously determine the thickness of a tens of nanometers thick growing oxide layer in real-time. Despite the lack of clarity in the particular set of experimental results presented here, the potential for the methods developed in this thesis is large. In-situ materials testing of this type may allow for a drastic increase in the pace of materials development by reducing the need for post-evolution, destructive materials testing between each design iteration.},

Applicable methods of mechanical spectroscopy are surveyed, noting their potential usefulness for characterizing radiation-induced microstructural changes in situ. The transient grating (TG) spectroscopy technique appears most suited for these studies, due to its noncontact, nondestructive nature, its ability to rapidly probe materials to the depth of ion irradiation, and the large number of deconvolvable components extractable from its signal. Work is proposed to separate the individual mechanisms of irradiation damage using in situ and ex situ TG spectroscopy, through a suite of single-effect and integrated experiments.},

abstract = {The elastic and thermal transport properties of opaque materials may be measured using transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) by inducing and monitoring periodic excitations in both reflectivity and surface displacement. The "phase grating" response encodes both properties of interest, but complicates quantitative analysis by convolving temperature dynamics with surface displacement dynamics. Thus, thermal transport characteristics are typically determined using the "amplitude grating" response to isolate the surface temperature dynamics. However, this signal character requires absolute heterodyne phase calibration and contains no elastic property information. Here, a method is developed by which phase grating TGS measurements may be consistently analyzed to determine thermal diffusivity with no prior knowledge of the expected properties. To demonstrate this ability, the wavelength-dependent 1D effective thermal diffusivity of pure germanium is measured using this type of response and found to be consistent with theoretical predictions made by solving the Boltzmann transport equation. This ability to determine the elastic and thermal properties from a single set of TGS measurements will be particularly advantageous for new in situ implementations of the technique being used to study dynamic materials systems.},

abstract = {Photovoltaic devices usually exploit mid-range band-gap semiconductors which absorb in the visible range of the solar spectrum. However, much energy is lost in the IR and near-IR range. We combined the advantages of small band-gap, bulk-like PbS deposited by facile, cheap and direct chemical bath deposition (CBD), with the good electronic properties of ZnO and the large surface area of nanowires, towards low cost photovoltaic devices utilizing IR and near-IR light. Surprisingly, CBD of PbS on ZnO, and particularly on ZnO nanowires, was not studied hitherto. Therefore, the mechanism of PbS growth by chemical bath deposition on ZnO nanowires was studied in details. A visible proof is shown for a growth mechanism starting from amorphous Pb(OH)2layer, that evolved into the 'ion-by-ion' growth mechanism. The growth mechanism and the resulting morphology at low temperatures were controlled by the thiourea concentration. The grain size affected the magnitude of the band-gap and was controlled by the deposition temperatures. Deposition above 40 C resulted in bulk-like PbS with an optical band-gap of 0.4 eV. Methods were demonstrated for achieving complete PbS coverage of the complex ZnO NW architecture, a crucial requirement in optoelectronic devices to prevent shorts. Measurements of photocurrents under white and near-IR (784 nm) illumination showed that despite a 200 meV barrier for electron transfer at the PbS/ZnO interface, extraction of photo-electrons from PbS to the ZnO was feasible. The ability to harvest electrons from a narrow band-gap semiconductor deposited on a large surface-area electrode can advance the field towards high efficiency, low cost IR and near-IR sensors and third generation solar cells.},
