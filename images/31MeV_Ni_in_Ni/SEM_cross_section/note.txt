All FIB cross-sectioning and subsequent imaging was conducted on a FEI Helios 600 NanoLab dual-beam SEM/FIB. 
Platinum protective layers normally 10x1x0.5 um were deposited using a 40pA, 30kV, Ga ion beam and 
cross-sections subsequently milled and polished using the Ga beam at 0.79nA and 30kV. SEM Images were largely 
taken in secondary electron mode at the machine eucentric angle of 52 degrees using an accelerating voltage of 
3kV and a current of 0.40nA, unless otherwise noted.
